Watching an NFL game, you'll often hear announcers emphasize a quarterback's ability to \"throw a receiver open\" or \"put the ball on a receiver's body\". Despite the importance of timing and ball placement, our group has never seen these quantified on a broadcast or displayed with a metric.\n\nIn this analysis, we introduce an in-stride metric that evaluates how well quarterbacks are able minimize route disruption to the receiver from the moment the ball is thrown to the moment it arrives. We focus mainly on the idea of acceleration and how much a receiver is speeding up or slowing down the moments before and after the ball is thrown. \n\nThis idea is derived from the frame-by-frame tracking movement provided in the competitaion. Plays in which receivers are able maintain a relatively consistent acceleration will be considered to be “in-stride” receptions, with the idea that they reflect good quarterback ball placement and timing with their intended target.\n\nOur goals in this notebook are as follows:\n1. Quantify receiver disruption using acceleration changes within routes.\n2. Explore whether reduced disruption leads to better play outcomes, such as an increase in yards gained or higher EPA.\n3. Aggregate the disruptions to the quarterback level to identify which QBs are best at sustaining wide receiver momentum.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📦 Data Description and Preparation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook relies on all three components of the NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 data that covers Weeks 1 to 18 of the 2023 season. The first component is the input  data, which contains frame-by-frame player movement information before the ball is thrown. These files also include identifiers such as game ID, play ID, and frame ID, along with each player’s NFL ID, position, name, and role on the specific play. The input data also has field coordinates (x and y) and several motion variables, including speed, acceleration, and directional orientation. The second component is the output data, which captures player movement after the ball is released. These files also include the key identifiers and field coordinates, but do not provide speed, acceleration, or direction. In this notebook, those values must are reconstructed directly from the positional changes across frames. Lastly, the supplementary dataset provides play-level context and outcomes, including yards gained, pass result, expected points added, and defensive coverage information. Because the tracking data is recorded at 10 frames per second across every play, the input, output, and supplementary files can be consistently merged on game ID, play ID, and player ID.\n\nData preparation involved loading the R libraries (tidyverse, data.table, and zoo) and establishing Kaggle directory paths to access the competition data. To process the full season, we created a helper function that locates and loads all 18 weekly input and output files, binding them into a single, season-long table for each. The supplementary file was then loaded and all identifiers were standardized to integer format to ensure clean joins down the line. From the input table, we identified targeted receivers using player roles, which allowed us to isolate the players whose pre- and post-throw movements are needed to analyze in-stride performance. With all the datasets cleaned, filtered, and merged, we prepared final computation-ready tables for computing speed and acceleration. This data preprocessing established a consistent and reliable foundation for measuring the in-stride metric introduced in the following section.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#

🔧 Methods and Metric Definition","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our next objective was to construct a measure to quantify how much a receiver’s momentum is affected right before and right after the throw. We started by developing a disruption metric, that quantifies the degree to which acceleration changes before and after the ball is released.\n\nTo compute disruption, we first restricted the tracking data to only targeted receivers, since they are the players directly responsible for catching the pass and are the center of our analysis for timing and ball placement. Additionally, we decided to filter out incompletions, because we wanted to see how disruption was correlated with big plays and not be thrown off by a large number of plays where the yards gained is zero. Lastly, we filtered only for throws over 15 yards, because we felt this gave necessary reaction time to receivers to meaningully speed up or slow down. For each targeted player, we took a one-second window before the throw (the final 10 input frames) and a one-second window after the throw (the first 10 output frames). The pre-throw acceleration was defined as the mean of the final 10 smoothed acceleration values prior to release, and the post-throw acceleration was the mean of the first 10 values after release. We then computed disruption as the difference between these two. A positive disruption indicates increased acceleration directly after the ball was released, while a negative disruption indicates slowing down or hesitating. We also caclulated the absolute value of disruption to capture the magnitude of adjustment regardless of the direction it happened in.\n\nOnce disruption was calculated, we joined these play-level metrics to the supplementary dataset to incorporate play outcomes like as yards gained, pass result, and expected points added. This allowed us to examine how acceleration changes relate to actual on-field performance. We then produced an exploratory visualization plotting receiver disruption versus yards gained.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ============================\n# Calculate pre- and post-throw disruption\n# ============================\n\n# Restrict motion data to targeted receivers\ninput_tr  <- input_motion  |>\n  semi_join(targeted, by = c(\"game_id\",\"play_id\",\"nfl_id\"))\n\noutput_tr <- output_motion |>\n  semi_join(targeted, by = c(\"game_id\",\"play_id\",\"nfl_id\"))\n\n# Pre-throw window: last 10 frames before the throw\npre_window <- input_tr |>\n  group_by(game_id, play_id, nfl_id) |>\n  slice_max(frame_id, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE)\n\npre_summ <- pre_window |>\n  summarise(\n    mean_accel_pre = mean(accel_smooth, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Post-throw window: first 10 frames after the throw (output side)\npost_window <- output_tr |>\n  group_by(game_id, play_id, nfl_id) |>\n  slice_min(frame_id, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE)\n\npost_summ <- post_window |>\n  summarise(\n    mean_accel_post = mean(accel_smooth, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Combine and compute disruption\ndisruption_df <- pre_summ |>\n  inner_join(post_summ, by = c(\"game_id\",\"play_id\",\"nfl_id\")) |>\n  mutate(\n    # How much acceleration changes after the throw\n    disruption = mean_accel_post -

Big plays rarely occurred when receivers experienced large positive or negative shifts in acceleration after the ball left the quarterback’s hand. This suggests that the most successful plays occur when receivers are able to maintain momentum, rather than needing to accelerate or decelerate when adjusting to the throw.\n\nUsing this insight, we defined an \"in-stride\" passing play as any play where the absolute acceleration change fell between –2 and +2 yards/sec². However, because a large amount of plays naturally fell within this range, we did not want to assume it was meaningful without any validation. To check this, we constructed the below big-play rate visualization, comparing explosive gains (≥ 25 yards) for plays inside and outside this in-stride window.
