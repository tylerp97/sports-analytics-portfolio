# Sports Analytics Portfolion
I am a sport analytics graduate student with a background in applied data science and professional analytics consulting. My work focuses on transforming complex sport data into actions, supporting decision-making in high-performance, coaching, and sport-technology contexts.

This repository contains selected projects from my coursework showcasing applied modeling, visualization, and data-engineering workflows using real-world sport datasets.
